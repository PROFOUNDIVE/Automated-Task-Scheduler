# Automated Task Scheduler

Below is a **draft technical documentation** for the scheduling product described in the conversation. It integrates the user’s requirements, design considerations, and relevant research on optimal scheduling (including AI approaches). Please note that this document is a *high-level outline*, serving as a foundation for more detailed specifications and implementation plans.

# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This product aims to **minimize the time spent on planning schedules** by automatically:

1. Collecting task information (title, description, priority, estimated time).
2. Determining task order based on user-defined or AI-driven logic.
3. Creating provisional “time boxes” in Google Calendar.
4. Prompting the user after the planned end time to confirm task completion.
5. Keeping or removing the calendar block based on user feedback.

Beyond these core features, the system should remain flexible for future enhancements—such as *reinforcement learning (RL) or deep learning (DL)* for optimal job scheduling. The primary objective is to simplify scheduling so the user can stay focused on high-level priorities.

# 2. Feature Overview

1. **Task Creation**
    - **Inputs**: Title, Description, Priority (High/Medium/Low), Estimated Time (in minutes/hours).
    - **Process**: The user enters task data via a cross-platform interface (Windows, Android, etc.).
    - **Output**: A new task record is stored in the system’s database or a Notion-like workspace.
2. **Task Ordering**
    - **Logic**: Tasks are sorted or *scheduled* according to priority, due dates, or custom algorithms (e.g., simple heuristics, *reinforcement learning*, or more advanced job scheduling strategies).
    - **Outcome**: An ordered list of tasks with scheduled start/end times.
3. **Calendar Integration**
    - **Target**: Google Calendar (via APIs or a third-party automation tool like Zapier).
    - **Process**: Once tasks are prioritized, *time boxes* are created automatically on the calendar.
    - **Outcome**: A user’s day/week is populated with tasks in optimal sequence.
4. **Completion Feedback Loop**
    - **Trigger**: After a scheduled task’s end time passes, the system prompts the user (notification, email, or in-app).
    - **Action**:
        - **Yes**: The user confirms completion; the calendar entry remains.
        - **No**: The user indicates the task is unfinished; the time box is removed, and the system re-schedules the task in the next available slot.
5. **User Access & Modifications**
    - **Cross-platform**: Windows, Android, web.
    - **Manual Overrides**: The user can edit tasks, mark them completed early, or manually adjust the schedule.

# 4. Implementation Details

## 4.1 Data Model (Example Schema)

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Title** | Text | Task title |
| **Description** | Text | Detailed description |
| **Priority** | Enum | {High, Medium, Low} |
| **EstimatedTime** | Number | Estimated duration (minutes/hours) |
| **ScheduledTime** | DateTime | Start time (auto-generated) |
| **Done** | Boolean | Completion status (default: false) |
| **CalendarEventID** | String | Stores GCal event ID for reference |

This structure can be adapted if using Notion or a custom DB.

## 4.2 Scheduling Logic

### 4.2.1 Simple Heuristic Example

1. Sort tasks by priority (High > Medium > Low).
2. Within the same priority group, sort by shortest estimated time first (Shortest Job First).
3. Assign tasks in chronological order onto the calendar.

```python
def schedule_tasks(tasks):
    # Sort by priority desc, then by estimated time asc
    sorted_tasks = sorted(tasks, key=lambda t: (-t.priority, t.estimated_time))
    time_slots = []
    current_time = get_current_datetime()

    for task in sorted_tasks:
        end_time = current_time + timedelta(minutes=task.estimated_time)
        time_slots.append({
            'task': task,
            'start': current_time,
            'end': end_time
        })
        current_time = end_time

    return time_slots

```

### 4.2.2 Advanced (Reinforcement Learning or DL)

For more complex, real-time re-optimizations:

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: e.g., *Deep Q-Network (DQN)* or *Policy Gradient* that learns to place tasks optimally based on user interaction history (rewards = on-time completion, user satisfaction, etc.).
- **Neural Combinatorial Optimization**: Sequence-to-sequence or attention-based RL for ordering tasks, similar to TSP solutions.

## 4.3 Google Calendar Integration

### 4.3.1 Authentication

- Use OAuth 2.0 to obtain tokens to read/write events.
- If using Zapier: connect Google Calendar and Notion (or DB) through built-in OAuth steps.

### 4.3.2 Event Creation Template (Zapier Example)

```json
{
  "event": {
    "summary": "{{Task Title}}",
    "description": "{{Task Description}}",
    "start": {"dateTime": "{{Scheduled Start}}"},
    "end": {"dateTime": "{{Scheduled End}}"},
    "colorId": "{% if priority == 'High' %}11{% else %}7{% endif %}"
  }
}

```

- `colorId` can be conditionally set based on priority.

### 4.3.3 Event Feedback

- After an event’s end time, a Zap (or a background script) checks whether the user marked the task as done.
- If not done, the event is removed from the calendar; the task is rescheduled.

# 5. Technology Stack

| Layer | Options |
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend/UI** | React, Flutter, or Notion UI |
| **Backend** | Zapier (low code), Node.js, Python (FastAPI/Django), or custom server |
| **Database** | Notion DB, Firebase, PostgreSQL, or custom solution |
| **Calendar** | Google Calendar API |
| **AI/RL** | PyTorch/TensorFlow (optional for advanced scheduling) |
- **Key Criteria**: Cross-platform, real-time sync, expandability for advanced AI scheduling in the future.

---

# 6. Workflows & User Flows

1. **Task Creation**
    - User opens the UI → clicks “Add Task” → enters data → saves → triggers a *Zapier or backend* event to schedule the task.
2. **Scheduling & Calendar Sync**
    - The system (Zapier or backend script) sorts tasks → calculates start/end times → calls the Google Calendar API to create events.
3. **Completion Prompt**
    - On each event’s end time, a background process checks user confirmation.
    - If “Yes,” status → `Done = true`. If “No,” event is deleted, task is returned to the queue.
4. **Rescheduling**
    - The system re-runs the scheduling logic for any incomplete tasks or newly added tasks.

---

# 7. Security & Permissions

- **Google OAuth 2.0**: Ensure *read/write* permissions to the user’s Google Calendar are properly scoped.
- **Data Storage**: If using Notion, rely on Notion’s security model. If using a custom DB, implement proper encryption, secure hosting, and role-based access control.
- **User Authentication**: If building a custom web or mobile app, integrate sign-in with Google or another secure auth method.

---

# 8. Testing & QA

### 8.1 Unit Testing

- Validate scheduling logic with various priority & time constraints.
- Test event creation & deletion via mock or sandbox Google Calendar accounts.

### 8.2 Integration Testing

- Ensure Zapier triggers fire correctly in real time.
- Check data integrity in the DB/Notion after tasks are updated.

### 8.3 User Acceptance Testing

- Collect feedback on usability, including the prompt for completion.
- Measure satisfaction regarding scheduling accuracy and time saved.

---

# 9. Performance & Scalability

- **Batch Processing**: Consider running scheduling in 15-minute intervals if real-time triggers are expensive or if rate limits exist.
- **Caching/Local Storage**: Cache frequent data to minimize repeated calls to external APIs.
- **Rate Limits**: Google Calendar API usage is subject to quotas; plan for backoff strategies.

---

# 10. Potential Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**:
    - Basic Notion → Zapier → Google Calendar integration.
    - Simple priority-based scheduling logic.
2. **Phase 2**:
    - Automated feedback loop (Yes/No completion, immediate re-scheduling).
    - User notification system (push notifications, emails).
3. **Phase 3**:
    - *AI Enhancements*: Implement reinforcement learning for dynamic scheduling.
    - Predictive analytics for estimated completion times (historical data).

## Final Note

This *draft technical documentation* outlines the architectural vision and functional requirements for a dynamic scheduling product that leverages standard automation tools (like Zapier) and can be extended with advanced AI scheduling algorithms. Further detail—especially around the data structures, security, and user experience—should be specified based on team size, budget, and user feedback throughout the development lifecycle.
